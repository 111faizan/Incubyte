# Project Name

## Description

This project is a JavaScript-based application developed using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. TDD is a software development process where tests are written before the actual code. This ensures that the code is robust, reliable, and meets the specified requirements.

The project aims to [briefly describe the project's goal or purpose]. It includes a suite of automated tests to validate the functionality of the application, ensuring that each feature works as intended.

## Features

. Add Books:
• Users should be able to add new books to the library.
• Each book should have a unique identifier (e.g., ISBN), title, author, and
publication year.
. Borrow Books:
• Users should be able to borrow a book from the library.
• The system should ensure that the book is available before allowing it to be
borrowed.
• If the book is not available, the system should raise an appropriate error.
. Return Books:
• Users should be able to return a borrowed book.
• The system should update the availability of the book accordingly.
. View Available Books:
• Users should be able to view a list of all available books in the library.

## Technologies Used
